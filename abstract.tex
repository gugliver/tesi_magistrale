This thesis was developed during an work period at Barcelona Supercomputing Center. It is specialized in High Performance Computing and research for a lot of ares of interest.\\

I had the opportunity to take part at the EPI project, a project for an European Open Source processor, based on RISC-V specifications. In particular the BSC is developing a Vector Processing Unit.\\
 
Modern architectures are increasing in capabilities but at the same time they are getting better in low-power applications.
This  is a problem for standard architectures and it's leading to develop logic based on parallelism at high efficiency.\\

There are different of ways to take advantage of parallelism: super-scalar processors, pipelines and vectors. In particular vector extensions are used to add the power of parallelism to a simple RISC architecture. A famous example is the V-Extension of the RISC-V architecture. This allows to gain computational power and develop modularity.\\

The work was done during the developing of the Vector Processing Unit. This unit tries to solve all the needs about parallelism and modularity.\\

In this thesis there will be discussed all the techniques used to verify the design of this VPU. There will be also reported the results of such work as founded bugs or created material.
